I woke up with my annoying dog barking in my face and my even more annoying sister, Tabitha, screaming as usual(I have 6 extremely annoying sisters and this one is the most annoying). In only ten minutes from when I woke up I was already in trouble for hurting another one of my annoying sisters. This is the second most annoying one. Because of my sisters screaming and shouting, I left ten minutes later than I should've done which happens all the time. My mum drove me me to school and I only just caught the bus. 

When I got into school I shoved my heavy bag in my locker and got my friend Joe to show me to where I should put my guitar for music. My first lesson was IT ; with Mr Keen my IT teacher, which is always fun, where we learnt how to change the colour of this blog. After IT me and my classmates had Science and English, but nothing exciting happened in those two hours so I'm not going to tell you anything about them.

Finally, after a long and busy morning it was lunch, and I looooooooove food. Our final two period were History and Music. In History we made our board games, mine, Morgans and Finn's is called Monastropoly which is a better and quicker version of monopoly involving Henry VIII. Finally we had music which we performed or sung a song. I played jingle bells on the guitar.

When I got home I heard very sad news. My big sister Katherine was coming over. After that my mum made me do my IT homework, which is this blog, and here I am now writing this very blog.
